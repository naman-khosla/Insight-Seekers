## Project Name: Insight Seekers - Data Exploration and Mining

### Description:
The project by the Insight Seekers team aimed to utilize advanced data mining techniques to analyze the spread and control measures for COVID-19. The team applied association mining to identify hotspots from patient route data, explored sequence analysis to understand the order of location visits by infected individuals, and utilized clustering to profile characteristics of COVID-19 positive individuals based on their behavioral and demographic data.

### Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for modeling and mining
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Key Features:
Preprocessing steps including conversion of data types, handling missing values, and sorting data for chronological analysis.
Association rule mining to find significant frequent patterns in patient movement data.
Clustering to identify common characteristics among COVID-19 positive individuals.
Decision trees and regression models for predictive analysis.

### Challenges Faced:
Dealing with large, incomplete datasets that required extensive cleaning and transformation.
Choosing appropriate parameters for mining algorithms to ensure meaningful and actionable insights.
Integrating results from different data mining techniques to provide comprehensive insights.

### Outcome/Results:
Identified key hotspots and routes frequented by COVID-19 positive patients, aiding in targeted public health interventions.
Profiled typical characteristics of infected individuals, helping in understanding risk factors and prevention strategies.
Developed predictive models to forecast potential new cases based on observed patterns, supporting proactive health measures.
